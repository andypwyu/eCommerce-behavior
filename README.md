## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

This is DSND Term 2 Write-a-Data-Science-Blog-Post project. In this project, I use eCommerce behavior data to explore:

Question 1: Daily traffic in November?

Question 2: What product categories and brands are the most popular?

Question 3: Will the customer purchases the products while adding them to the shopping cart?
